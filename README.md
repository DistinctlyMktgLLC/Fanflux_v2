User Guide

Sidebar Menu
The sidebar allows you to navigate between different sections:

Home: Overview of Fanflux and its objectives.
Leagues Analysis: Detailed analysis across different leagues.
Chatbot: Interact with an AI-powered assistant for additional insights.
Filters
Use the filters on the left side to narrow down the data:

Fandom Level: Choose between Avid, Casual, and Convertible fans.
Race: Filter by racial demographics.
League: Select the league (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL).
Team: Focus on specific teams within the selected league.

Visualizations

Scorecards: Display total counts of Avid, Casual, and Convertible fans. These numbers always represent the total fans based on the selected filters, not just the sampled data points.

Important Notes
Sampling
To ensure fast performance, the map visualization defaults to showing a sample of 1,000 data points. However, the scorecards always reflect the total number of fans based on the current filters, providing a comprehensive view of the data. This approach balances performance with accuracy, ensuring users can interact with the data quickly without compromising on insights.

Fan Engagement Levels
Based on insights from the R/GA report, fan engagement has evolved:

On-Demand Fans: Engage with sports through broader cultural and social contexts, not just live games.
Avid Fans: Traditional, deeply engaged fans who follow games and statistics closely.
Casual Fans: Less engaged, but still contribute to the overall fanbase and potential monetization.

Conclusion
Fanflux is designed to bridge the gap between data and actionable insights, helping sports organizations and brands to better understand and engage their audience. By leveraging advanced data analytics and interactive visualizations, Fanflux provides a comprehensive toolset for maximizing fan engagement and economic potential.
